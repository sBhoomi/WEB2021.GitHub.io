              <p>The science behind the build-up mechanism of polyelectrolyte multilayers is important for developing devices for various engineering applications. Here we, study the dependency of thickness of polyelectrolyte multilayer films, fabricated using spin-assisted layer-by-layer self-assembly of polyelectrolytes technique, with respect to varying spin-speed while keeping all other parameters of the fabrication process-window constant.</p>

            <p>
              The intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech is essential for planning therapy. Time-frequency representations have been used for automatic intelligibility assessment of dysarthria. These representations have been derived from the utterance as a whole. As voiced and unvoiced components have different characteristics; in this work, we use different time-frequency representations for voiced and unvoiced segments and use them for intelligibility assessment with CNN classifier.

          A zero-index based metasurface (MTS) is used to increase the gain of a circularly polarized (CP) patch antenna. The patch antenna is truncated at its corner to obtain the CP wave. The patch antenna gain in increased by loading the metasurface. The proposed CP antenna with enhanced gain is fabricated and verified experimentally.
